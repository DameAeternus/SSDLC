**Basic CORS Testing with Burp Suite**:

- Intercept a request to the server (e.g., a request to `https://seg.vss.mk/api/v1/?format=api`) using **Burp Suite**.
- Modify the `Origin` header to a different domain (e.g., `Origin: http://attacker.com`) and forward the request.
- If the server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or includes the origin `http://attacker.com` in its response, it means the server is allowing requests from external domains, which is a CORS misconfiguration.
##  **Using curl to Test CORS**
You can use `curl` to test CORS as well by adding a custom `Origin` header:
    `curl -H "Origin: http://attacker.com" -I https://seg.vss.mk/api/v1/?format=api`
    
    If the response contains `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://attacker.com`, it indicates a CORS misconfiguration.
    

#### **Exploiting CORS Misconfigurations**:

If the server allows cross-origin requests from untrusted origins, an attacker could:

- **Steal user session information** by making cross-origin authenticated requests.
- **Execute unauthorized actions** on behalf of an authenticated user.
