We can automate the commands instead of typing them manually with resource scripts. Example:
We use msf and after we use commands we do `makerc [path]` to make the script of the last commands used
`msfconsole -r openports.rc `(to open msf with a resource script)
to open up a resource in msfconsole:
`resource [location of .rc]`
